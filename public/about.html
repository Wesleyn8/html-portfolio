<h2>Top 5 Things I Love To Do</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Travling
    <p>
      Me and my wife have traveled alot since we been married even before hand.
      The number one way we love to travel is by cruises. Mosr recent cruise
      we've been on is Royal Caribbean. We plan on someday being able to take a
      30-45 day cruise maybe even longer

    Learn
    <p>
      I believe learning and knowledge is the key to success. Since I was little
      I can always rememeber tinkering with things and working with my hands.
      Then I found out about coding and it just peaked my interest even more.

    Being In A Group
    <p>
      Being in a group just fills me with excitment because everybody has came
      from a different background. Everybody is able to come togather and
      provide some type of knowledge to help others. Also just being able to
      bond with your teamates and provide something to a team makes it better
      place and able to build relationships
    </p>

    Watching Anime
    <p>
      Dragon Ball Z, One Punch Man, Black Butler etc. Anime just has a lot of
      meaning and awesome story telling. Enough said.

    Spending Time With Wife
    <p>
      The most important of all is spending time with my other half. My other
      half has encourage me so much to pursue what is gonna be best for us. She
